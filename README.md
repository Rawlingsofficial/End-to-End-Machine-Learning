# Machine Learning Fundamentals Showcase

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide reflecting my understanding of the end-to-end machine learning fundamentals. It demonstrates the essential practices and methodologies that I consider crucial when embarking on a machine learning project.

## Overview

As someone passionate about machine learning, I've compiled this repository to highlight the key steps and processes involved in the entire machine learning lifecycle. From problem definition to model deployment, this showcase encapsulates the fundamental practices that contribute to successful machine learning projects.

## Key Practices

1. **Problem Definition:**
   - Clearly define the problem you aim to solve and articulate the project's goals.

2. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather relevant data aligning with the defined problem and goals.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and preprocess the data to address any discrepancies, outliers, or missing values.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset's structure and relationships.

5. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create or transform features to enhance the model's ability to capture patterns.

6. **Model Selection:**
   - Choose the most suitable machine learning algorithm based on the problem type.

7. **Model Training:**
   - Train the selected model using the prepared dataset.

8. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and validation techniques.

9. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Fine-tune model hyperparameters for optimal performance.

10. **Model Deployment:**
    - Deploy the trained model for real-world applications.
